# AI Opportunities in Academia
A list of opportunities for undergraduate students looking for solid academic opportunities in AI.

Some of these programs are not explicitly centered on AI/ML/DL, but still offer the perfect opportunity to study AI. For example---Stanford's CSLI institute brings together language, psychology, and philosophy---but its members regularly publish in top NLP conferences such as EMNLP, ACL, etc.
